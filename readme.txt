- when ready to push the branch on github:
	git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]
- delete local branch:
	git branch -d [name_of_your_new_branch]

COMMIT MESSAGE STRUCTURE:
"UPDATED/ADDED/DELETED [file_name] (for big changes) | UPDATED/ADDED/DELETED [function_name] in [file_name] (small changes in functions) | ADDITIONAL EXPLANATION IF NECESSARY"
